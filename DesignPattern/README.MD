# Modern C++ Design Patterns

Software design patterns provide a structured approach to solving common design problems in software development. They encapsulate solutions to recurring design challenges and provide a common vocabulary for developers to communicate and share best practices. By utilizing design patterns, developers can benefit from proven solutions that promote maintainability, scalability, and reusability in their software systems.

The Gang of Four (GoF) book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" introduced 23 classic software design patterns, which are categorized into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Each pattern addresses a specific design problem and provides a blueprint for implementing an effective solution.

Here's a brief overview of the three main categories of design patterns:

Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in creating objects while hiding the creation logic. Examples include Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder, and Prototype patterns.

Structural Patterns: Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They help in building relationships between objects and classes to form a cohesive system. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns.

Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities between them. They facilitate the interaction and collaboration between objects, improving the flexibility of the system. Examples include Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor, and Interpreter patterns.

By understanding and applying these design patterns, software developers can improve the quality, maintainability, and extensibility of their software systems. Design patterns serve as a valuable resource for software developers to address common design challenges and create robust, scalable, and maintainable software solutions.
