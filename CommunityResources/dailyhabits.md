My 8 daily habits that will make you a better developer:

1. Dedicate time to learning
Block out specific time in your calendar for learning new languages, frameworks or best practices. The landscape is constantly evolving and you need to build the habit of staying ahead of the curve.

2. Practice-problem solving
Coding is all about problem solving. Tackle some coding challenges, build a real puzzle or do some brain teaser. Keep your mind active and improve your problem solving skills.

3. Collaborate and communicate
Great developers are team players. Practice effective communication through sharing your knowledge, ideas and experience with others.

4. Embrace code reviews
Don't shy away from reviews. Being open to feedback is the best habit you can have.

5. Prioritize time management
Break down work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This helps you to stay focuses and productive.

6. Write clean code
Take the extra time required to write cleaner code. It's an investment that has the best returns.

7. Test, Test, Test
Build a habit of thorough testing. You'll thank yourself later.

8. Take care of yourself
Your health and mindset directly impact your productivity. A healthy developer is a productive developer.
