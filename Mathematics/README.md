# Discriminant

The discriminant is a term used in the context of quadratic equations and is part of the quadratic formula. For a quadratic equation in the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), the discriminant is given by the expression inside the square root of the quadratic formula:

[Discriminant = b^2 - 4ac]

The discriminant plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation. Its value provides information about whether the roots are real or complex and whether they are distinct or repeated.

The discriminant can take on three different cases:

1. If Discriminant > 0:
   - Two distinct real roots exist.

2. If Discriminant = 0:
   - There is one real root (a repeated or double root).

3. If Discriminant < 0:
   - The roots are complex conjugates (they have both real and imaginary parts).

The discriminant helps in classifying the solutions and is a fundamental concept when dealing with quadratic equations and their graphical representation. In programming, it is often used to guide the branching logic in solving quadratic equations.
