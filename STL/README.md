# C++ Standard Template Library
The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a generic collection of class templates and
algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement standard data structures like
queues, lists, and stacks.

## Containers library
The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement common data structures like queues, lists and stacks. There are two(until C++11) three (since C++11) classes of containers:
- sequence containers,
- associative containers, and
- unordered associative containers, (since C++11)

each of which is designed to support a different set of operations.

The container manages the storage space that is allocated for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators (objects with properties similar to pointers).

Most containers have at least several member functions in common, and share functionalities. Which container is the best for the particular application depends not only on the offered functionality, but also on its efficiency for different workloads.
