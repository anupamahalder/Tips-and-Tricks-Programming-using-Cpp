As a junior software developer I constantly worried I wasn't good enough. I constantly compared myself to others.

As a junior software developer I worked for a financial company. It was my first big city job. I was proud of myself.

After joining, I worked out my role was open because the previous junior had left.

I would always find myself stumbling across the previous juniors work. It was brilliant. I thought they were so much smarter. I wondered why this company had settled for me if they could have that.

After a while of feeling like this, I told my boss how I felt, I told them I would work my best to try and fill the void left by the previous junior and that I knew my shortfalls were significant.

That day was the first day I can remember experiencing having a leader as my boss and not a manager. All my previous managers had been only that. The memories of the conversation are vivid and help shape who I am today.

They told me that they were not looking for a direct replacement. That I bring so many fantastic qualities to the team and when hiring they were looking for a value add to the team as it stands now, not a value replacement to get it back to what it was then. From that moment I felt so much better.

We should always be open with how we are feeling and thoughts such as imposter syndrome. Being a junior is a daunting time in a career. There are so many unanswered questions.

I encourage you to seek answers to those lingering thoughts that are standing in the way of your progress.
