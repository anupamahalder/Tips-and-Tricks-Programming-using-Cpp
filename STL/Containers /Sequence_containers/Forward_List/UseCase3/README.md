# Singly Linked List Operations in C++

This repository contains implementations of various operations on singly linked lists using C++. The operations include inserting elements, deleting the middle element, and finding the middle node of the list.

## Overview

A singly linked list is a type of data structure where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. This example demonstrates how to perform various operations on singly linked lists, including:
- Inserting elements at the end of the list.
- Deleting the middle element of the list.
- Finding the middle node of the list.

## Example 1: Insert and Delete Middle Element
