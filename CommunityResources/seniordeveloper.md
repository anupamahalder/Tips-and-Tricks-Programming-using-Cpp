As a developer, the best way to go from mid to senior is to get a job as a senior. That's it.

The reality is outside of MAANG, expectations of a senior vary wildly.

Some seniors are very well rounded, great communicators, drive technical excellence, nurture and support, they become a force multiplier by helping their team grow.

Others have no responsibility and don't even have a team or they dictate their uninformed opinion on everything as fact.

There are qualities that all seniors should aspire to

âœ… Good communicator and listener
âœ… Supports and mentors
âœ… Challenges and adjusts process
âœ… Influences technical, company and design decisions
âœ… Designs and creates software used internally and externally
âœ… Leads technical excellence and quality

But these aren't what it actually takes to land a senior role and context for a "senior" is a strong defining factor.

Personally, I've had senior roles where the business needs me to be the bull in a china shop, attacking process, attacking code quality. Breaking things down to help build them back up again.

Other roles, they've needed me to mentor others, document, support and influence design decisions.

When people give you a hard definition of what a "senior developer" is it's usually because

ðŸš© They're talking about MAANG,
ðŸš© They don't have enough diversity or experience themselves
OR
ðŸš© They fancy themselves an influencer and are just reeling off qualities they think they have.

Strive to adopt the qualities above, they're good qualities for any developer.

But don't over think it, if you see a senior role, and you think you'll be good for it - apply.

You never know, they might agree.
