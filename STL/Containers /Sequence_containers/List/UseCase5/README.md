# Basic Operations on a Doubly Linked List using C++ STL

This repository demonstrates basic operations on a doubly linked list using the C++ Standard Library's `std::list` container. The operations include accessing the front and back elements, inserting elements at both ends, removing elements, and iterating through the list.

## Overview

The `std::list` container in C++ provides a doubly linked list implementation. This example covers the following operations:
- Accessing the first and last elements.
- Adding elements to the front and back.
- Removing elements from the front and back.
- Iterating through the list.
- Retrieving the size of the list.
