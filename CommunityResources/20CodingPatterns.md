# Grokking the Coding Interview: Mastering the 20 Coding Patterns
_How Mastering Coding Patterns Can Transform Your Interview Performance._<br>
In today’s competitive job market, coding interviews are becoming harder every day. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, it’s essential to understand how to approach a coding interview. Knowing what interview questions could be asked is only part of the battle; you also need to have the skills to tackle them successfully.

If you’re reading this, you are likely preparing for that all-important coding interview or simply looking to expand your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Either way, you’re in the right place.

There’s no doubt, a well-prepared candidate is often the successful one. But how can you ensure that you’re fully prepared to take on whatever problem is thrown your way?

This is where pattern recognition comes into play. Recognizing patterns in problem statements can provide valuable insights into how to approach the solution. These programming patterns, like Sliding Window, Two Heaps, etc., serve as a framework for constructing an optimal algorithm. They are the secret tools used by expert programmers to decode complex coding challenges.

In the upcoming sections of this blog, I’ll introduce you to 20 distinct coding interview patterns. You’ll gain insight into the essence of each pattern, its practical usage, and typical problems that can be solved using each pattern. As we demystify each pattern, you’ll soon realize that they’re not as daunting as they initially seem.

By understanding and implementing these patterns, you can develop a robust problem-solving mindset. Whether it’s a startup or big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft, a candidate’s ability to solve problems efficiently is what interviewers look for. Coding interviews are not about memorizing solutions; they are about problem-solving, critical thinking, and, above all, the correct approach.

Let’s get started.

## 20 Coding Interview Patterns to the Rescue
Here are the top 20 coding interview patterns discussed in Grokking the Coding Interview:

1. **Pattern: Two Pointers**<br>

   Problems: ‘Reverse a LinkedList’, ‘Reverse a Sub-list’, ‘Reverse Every K-element Sub-list’.

8. **Pattern: Tree Breadth First Search**
   Description: This pattern involves level-by-level traversal of a tree.

   Problems: ‘Binary Tree Level Order Traversal’, ‘Reverse Level Order Traversal’, ‘Zigzag Traversal’.

9. **Pattern: Tree Depth First Search**
   Description: This pattern involves traversing a tree or graph depth-wise before visiting siblings or neighbors.
   Usage: It’s used when you need to search deeper into a tree/graph first before going across.
   Problems: ‘Binary Tree Path Sum’, ‘All Paths for a Sum’, ‘Count Paths for a Sum’.

10. **Pattern: Two Heaps**
   Description: This pattern involves using two heaps to divide a set of numbers into two parts.
