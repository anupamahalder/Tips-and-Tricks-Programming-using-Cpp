# Demonstrating `std::array` Operations in C++

This repository demonstrates various operations on `std::array`, a fixed-size array provided by the C++ Standard Library. The operations include accessing elements, sorting, filling, swapping, and more.

## Overview

The `std::array` container in C++ provides a fixed-size array with the advantages of standard container operations. This example covers the following operations:
- Accessing the size of the array.
- Accessing elements using `[]`, `at()`, `front()`, and `back()`.
- Sorting the array.
- Filling the array with a specific value.
- Swapping arrays.
- Checking if the array is empty.
- Accessing the underlying data pointer.
