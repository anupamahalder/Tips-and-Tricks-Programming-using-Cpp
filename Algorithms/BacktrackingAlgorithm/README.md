# Backtracking Algorithms

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithm that employs a brute force approach to finding the desired output. By trying out all possible solutions and choosing the best one, this method is effective for solving problems with multiple solutions. The term "backtracking" implies that if the current solution is unsuitable, the algorithm backtracks and explores other solutions, often utilizing recursion. Backtracking algorithms are problem-solving strategies that involve exploring different options until the best solution is found. They work by attempting different paths and backtracking if necessary, akin to solving a puzzle by testing different pieces until they fit together perfectly.
