# Tips and Tricks for Programming using Cpp

Welcome to the GitHub repository! Here, you will find all the code and resources related to my [**Medium**](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/) articles on practical tips for developers using **C++**. As a passionate advocate for empowering developers with up-to-date knowledge, I have created this repository to share my insights and expertise with the tech community.

With a focus on practical solutions and real-world examples, my articles cover a wide range of topics related to **C++ programming**. From mastering the basics to tackling more advanced concepts, I provide tips and guidance to help developers of all skill levels achieve their goals.

So, whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this repository is the perfect place to find valuable resources and insights. Together, let's build a stronger, more empowered tech community!

## How to Use
To use these programs, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can then download the program files from this repository and compile them using the compiler.

C++ is a compiled language. That means that to get a program to run, you must first translate it from the human-readable form to something a machine can “understand.” That translation is done by a program called a compiler.

Typically C++ source code files are given the suffix:
1. .cpp (ex: firstCode.cpp) or
2. .h (ex: std_lib_facilities.h).

- Compile:
g++ firstCode.cpp -o firstCode <br>
A compiler translates the C++ program into machine language code which it stores on the disk as a file with the extension .o (e.g. firstCode.o). A linker then links the object code with standard library routines that the program may use and creates an executable image which is also saved on disk, usually as a file with the file name without any extension (e.g. firstCode).

- Execute:
./firstCode <br>
The executable is loaded from the disk to memory and the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.
Alternatively, you can also use an online C++ compiler to run these programs without needing to install a compiler on your computer.

## Getting Started
To compile and run these programs on your local machine, you'll need to have the appropriate programming language and compiler installed. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the program you want to run.
3. Follow the instructions in the program's README file to compile and run the program.
