/*
This program uses a brute force approach to check every number in the given range to see if it is prime or not. 
The isPrime function checks if a given number is prime by iterating through all the numbers from 2 to n-1 and 
checking if any of them divide n evenly. If none do, the function returns true indicating that n is prime. The 
main function takes input for the range of numbers to check and uses a for loop to iterate through all the numbers 
in the range, calling the isPrime function on each one. If a number is prime, it is printed to the console.
