When it comes to dynamic memory allocation in C++, the use of malloc() and free() might seem like a convenient option. However, there are crucial reasons to steer clear of these functions, especially when working with C++ objects.

🚧 𝗡𝗼 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 🚧 One significant drawback of malloc() and free() is their lack of support for the proper construction and destruction of C++ objects. For instance, consider the code snippet in the PDF.

As shown, using malloc() can lead to uninitialized objects, which can cause unexpected behavior.

🔄 𝗠𝗶𝘅𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲 🔄 Mixing malloc() and free() with new and delete can result in errors and is generally considered bad practice. Deleting an object allocated by malloc() or freeing an object allocated by new can lead to undefined behavior.

🚨 𝗘𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁 𝗨𝘀𝗲 🚨 It is crucial to flag the explicit use of malloc() and free() in your codebase by using comments or any other method that makes these instances easily noticeable during code review or analysis. While some implementations might allow the mixing of these memory allocation methods, it's not guaranteed and can cause runtime errors.

🚫 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱-𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 🚫 In life-critical hard-real-time code, exceptions may not be acceptable. In such cases, consider using the nothrow versions of new to handle allocation failures without throwing exceptions.

📢 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 📢 While there are legitimate reasons to avoid exceptions, it's essential to distinguish between genuine concerns, such as hard-real-time requirements, and outdated beliefs. In some cases, the ban on exception use might be based on superstition or concerns about older code bases. Exercise caution and evaluate the specific needs of your application.

🔍 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 🔍 In modern C++, it's recommended to use new and delete for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. This approach ensures proper construction and destruction of objects, maintains code consistency, and minimizes the risk of runtime errors. Be explicit in your code about the use of memory allocation and choose the right approach based on your application's requirements.
